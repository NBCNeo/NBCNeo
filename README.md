### Welcome to my code articulation center :)

I'm a junior studying Artificial Intelligence and Economics @ Minerva Schools at KGI. 
<br/>
Backpacking around the world to explore its wonders, I have gained an appreciation for the role of technology at enhancing human lives. And, I want to play a part in that enhancement. That's all.

As a software developer, I love exploring the cutting edge of what exists, and learn the latest technologies.
<br/>
As a product manager, I aspire to build products that are accessible to all, and that help solve the most pressing issues we face as a generation.
